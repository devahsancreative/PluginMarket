Plugin Marketplace for Stud.IP
==============================

This plugin provides a plugin-marketplace for Stud.IP. That's true, a plugin that is a plugin-market distributing plugins.

The point is that the plugin-market for Stud.IP should be part of the Stud.IP framework so that each Stud.IP developer is able to contribute to the code of the marketplace. And also it should benefit from future developments in the UI of Stud.IP. And thirdly all users of the server https://develop.studip.de should be also members of the marketplace, follow plugins and upload their own plugins.

## Features

* Upload and download plugins.
* New UI that is more Stud.IP-ish.
* Notifies all users of develop.studip.de of newly published plugins.
* Easy rating of plugins and writing reviews for plugins.
* Integrating of github-repositories, so that Stud.IP gets the code of the plugin-release directly from github.
* Provides webhook-URLs for gitlab and github, so that github-repositories might push their changes via webhook to Stud.IP PluginMarket.
* Hidden plugins that are not published (yet?).
* Better review-process for the admins to give feedback to the developer of a plugin, if the plugin is not qualified to get published in the market.
